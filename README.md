# Polygon

## Polygon's hybrid Security Model (Proof-of-Stake and Plasma)

* Polygon uses a dual Consensus Mechanism - a Combination of Plasma and PoS that optimizes the Speed and Decentralization of the Polygon Network
* Polygon brings a trust-less two-way Transaction Chanel between Polygon and Ethereum by introducing a Cross-Chain Bridge with Plasma Bridge and PoS Bridge
* Using the Cross-Chain Bridge Users can transfer their Tokens between Polygon
* The Polygon Bridge brings a Scaling Solution that is nearly no Costs and wide flexible
* Polygon Tokens (MATIC) are backed by Ethereum Tokens (ETH) - there is a One-to-One Ratio

| |PoS Bridge|Plasma Bridge|
|---|---|---|
|Description|PoSBridge is looking for Flexibility and faster Withdrawals with the PoS Consensus Mechanism|Plasma Bridge is looking for increased Security guarantees by with Plasma Consensus Mechanism|
|Security|PoS Bridge is secured by a robust Set of external Validators|Plasma Bridge is secured by the Ethereum's Security with a 7 Days Challenge Period|

### Polygon Architecture

The Polygon Architecture consist of three Layer:

1) Staking and Plasma Contracts are deployed on Ethereum
1) Proof-of-Stake Layer (Heimdall) aggregates the Blocks that are produced from the Bor (MATIC Side Chain) and provide them to the Root Chain (Ethereum)
1) Block Producer Layer (Bor) is a Side Chain (MATIC Blockchain) to aggregate Transactions

* Only the Merkel Root of the Merkle Tree is stored in the Root Chain (Ethereum) from the Plasma Checkpoint Nodes (PoS)
